## Creating a New Skill

### Step 1: Describe your idea

Start a conversation with your AI assistant and tell it what you want to build. You don't need to know any technical details — just describe your idea in plain language.

**Examples of good starting points:**

- "I want to create a skill that generates social media posts with images for product promotion"
- "Help me build a skill that writes personalized marketing emails based on customer data"
- "I need a skill that creates product comparison tables from web research"

### Step 2: Answer a few questions

The assistant will ask you some questions to understand your idea better:

- **What does it do?** — The core purpose of the skill
- **Who is it for?** — The target audience and the problem it solves
- **What steps should it follow?** — The ideal workflow, step by step
- **What capabilities does it need?** — Image generation, web search, knowledge base access, etc.
- **Any examples?** — Sample inputs and expected outputs

{: .tip }
You don't have to have all the answers. The assistant can help fill in the gaps and suggest improvements.

### Step 3: Review the design

Before building, the assistant will show you a summary of what it plans to create:

> "Here's what I'll build: **Product Social Post Generator** — generates social media posts with AI images for product promotion on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Does that sound right?"

You can adjust the design before the assistant starts building.

### Step 4: Build and iterate

The assistant creates the skill automatically. Once built, you'll see a summary of what was created. You can then:

- **Make changes** — "Can you add support for LinkedIn too?"
- **Test the workflow** — "Show me what the skill does step by step"
- **Publish immediately** — "Publish it to the marketplace"

---

## Browsing the Marketplace

Ask your assistant to show you what's available:

- "Show me skills on the marketplace"
- "Search for marketing skills"
- "Find skills related to image generation"

The assistant will show you a list of available skills with descriptions of what each one does.

---

## Copying and Customizing Existing Skills

Found a skill you like but want to modify it? Just ask:

- "I want to create my own version of [skill name]"
- "Copy that skill so I can customize it"

The assistant will create a personal copy that you can edit freely.

---

## Editing Your Skills

To modify a skill you've already created:

- "Show me my skills"
- "Edit [skill name]"
- "I want to change how [skill name] works"

The assistant will show you what the skill currently does and help you make changes.

---

## Publishing to the Marketplace

When your skill is ready to share, just say:

- "Publish my skill to the marketplace"
- "Share [skill name] with the community"

The assistant will:
1. Ask for your name (as the author) and suggest relevant tags
2. Run a quality check to make sure everything is in order
3. Fix any issues automatically
4. Publish it to the marketplace

{: .note }
You can update a published skill at any time — just edit it and tell the assistant to publish the update.

---

## Installing Marketplace Skills

To add skills created by others:

- "Install [skill name] from the marketplace"
- "I want to use that skill"

---

## Deleting Skills

To remove a skill from your collection:

- "Delete [skill name]"

The assistant will confirm before deleting, since this action cannot be undone.

## Tips for Success

1. **Start simple** — Begin with a straightforward workflow, then add complexity
2. **Be specific** — "Generate Instagram posts for food products" is better than "help with social media"
3. **Include examples** — Show the assistant what good output looks like
4. **Test before publishing** — Review the skill workflow to make sure it does what you expect
5. **Iterate** — Your first version doesn't have to be perfect. Edit and improve over time
